# Machine-Learning
The 'Example Codes' directory has ML algorithms I coded up from scratch. I tested each one on a data set (usually Iris, sometimes synthetic random data). Algorithms currently include MCMC, Single-Layer Perceptron, Network Perceptron, KNN, and KMeans. 

The 'Brunel Perceptron' directory has some codes I wrote to emulate Nicolas Brunel's paper "Is Cortical Connectivity Optimized For Storing Information." I wrote those codes while preparing for a journal club where I presented his paper. I haven't had a chance to polish or build upon this. I was able to train the network to successfully learn quite a few patterns, but not nearly as many as Brunel.
