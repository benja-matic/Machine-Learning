# Machine-Learning
Algorithms coded from scratch (MCMC, perceptron, KNN, etc.) with working examples are in the 'Example Codes' directory.

The 'Brunel Perceptron' directory has some codes I wrote to Emulate Nicolas Brunel's paper "Is Cortical Connectivity Optimized For Storing Information." I wrote those codes while preparing for a journal club where I presented his paper. I haven't had a chance to polish them yet.
